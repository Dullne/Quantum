    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [1-3] is one of the most promising applications for near-term quantum computing. One of the its powerful versions is SSVQE [4], which can be used to find the ground state and the **excited state** of a physical system's Hamiltonian. Mathematically, one can interpret it as solving the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix. The set of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian is called the energy spectrum.\n",
    "- Next, we will use a brief example to demonstrate how to solve this problem by training a QNN, that is, to solve the energy spectrum of a given Hamiltonian $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hamiltonian \n",
    "\n",
    "- For a specific molecule that needs to be analyzed, we need its geometry, charge, and spin multiplicity to obtain the Hamiltonian (in Pauli products form) describing the system. Specifically, through our built-in quantum chemistry toolkit, fermionic-to-qubit mapping technology can be used to output the qubit Hamiltonian.\n",
    "- As a simple demonstration of SSVQE, we provide a random 2-qubit Hamiltonian."
